# Strikethrough Test

This is a test for strikethrough support.

Here's some ~~crossed out text~~ that should be rendered as strikethrough.

You can also combine it with other formatting:
- **Bold and ~~strikethrough~~**
- *Italic and ~~strikethrough~~*
- `Code and ~~strikethrough~~` (though the strikethrough won't work inside code)

Multiple ~~words~~ in a ~~sentence~~ should all work.
